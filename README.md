Ares' Database Client

This is meant to be an extremely modular client for remote database access at both an administrator and user level. 
This is also a test project, so expect a bit of spaghetti here and there until I have had time to go back and pretty things up.


INITIAL SETUP:
This program is made to connect to SQL databases. Ensure you enter your connection information correctly. This information can be changed manually in the .ini file included in the program.

The program will create the initial database for you as needed once it can connect properly to a server.

Enter your initial admin user log in information when prompted. This account is how you will access and alter the system to fit your needs initially.
